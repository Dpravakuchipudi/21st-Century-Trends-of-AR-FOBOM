# 21st Century Trends of AR: FOBOM  
*Augmented Reality Exploration using Spark AR and Unity 3D*

## 🧠 Introduction

**21st Century Trends of AR: FOBOM** explores how **Augmented Reality (AR)** is rapidly transforming everyday experiences across industries — from entertainment and fitness to design, education, and healthcare. This project demonstrates how AR can be made more **accessible**, **immersive**, and **practical** using widely available platforms like **Spark AR** and **Unity 3D**.

## ✨ Why the Project is Called “FOBOM”

> **FOBOM** stands for **“Fusion of Body, Object, and Mind”** in the context of AR interaction.

The title reflects a vision where **augmented content is seamlessly integrated into our reality**, blending digital overlays with how we move, perceive, and engage with the physical world. The project emphasizes:
- **Body-centric interaction** – via AR filters and body tracking games  
- **Object-based enhancement** – using 3D models in real-world spaces  
- **Mindful design** – enabling education, creativity, and healthcare through AR

In essence, **FOBOM** captures the **human-centered evolution of AR** in the 21st century.

## 🌍 Project Importance

- Makes AR **accessible** via mobile-based tools (no headsets required)
- Bridges **design, tech, and user experience** through practical use cases
- Encourages **gamified learning**, **immersive visualization**, and **creative expression**
- Showcases a complete **AR development pipeline** from concept to deployment

## 🧪 Project Methodology

This project followed an **Agile development approach**, involving:
1. **Requirement Analysis** – defining AR use cases across domains
2. **Design** – UI/UX layouts and 3D/2D asset modeling
3. **Development** – implementing with Spark AR Studio and Unity 3D
4. **Testing & Validation** – mobile testing, usability checks, iteration
5. **Deployment** – publishing to Instagram via Spark AR Hub or Android APKs
